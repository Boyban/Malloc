# Malloc

The purpose of the project is to recode three GLIBC Functions: Malloc, Free and Realloc.

Malloc is a function that allocate memory for a program.
Free is a function that frees the allocated memory.
Realloc is a function that reallocate a memory area.

See man malloc(3).

Use reverse_me_to_improve_your_malloc to test the malloc.
Don't forget to export LD_PRELOAD=$PWD/libmy_malloc.so

Enjoy !
